# Fuel & Energy Tracker

A simple React + TypeScript demo app to log vehicle trips (both EV and ICE) and calculate basic consumption metrics.  
The goal is to show clean code, TypeScript usage, and persistence via `localStorage`.

---

## Features
- Add new trip logs for EV (kWh) and ICE (liters)
- Store distance, consumption, unit price or total cost
- Data is saved in browser `localStorage` (stays even after refresh)
- Basic Bootstrap styling for a clean look
- TypeScript interfaces for strong typing

---

## Tech Stack
- [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (fast dev environment)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (type safety)
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) (UI styling)
- `localStorage` (simple persistence, no backend needed)
